## Card Pay Mobile Application
Downloading the application and registering is the first step user has to go through to ensure safety. 

### Steps involved:
1. Download the Card Pay application.
2. Register yourself using basic details like your image, picture of the card and phone verification. 
3. You have the choice to keep the card unlocked in case you don't want to go through the tedious (but important) steps time and again.
4. If you choose to keep it locked always, each time someone tries to transact through your card, you will get a notification after which you will have to verify your device, face and then allow the transaction to happen.
5. If you choose to keep it unlocked, you will still get notifications but you just have to accept or deny. No device and face verification is needed.

Card Pay keeps the user's cards safe and secure by properly authenticating a transaction and saving users from frauds.

*This is a user-friendly application and hope to see you using this very soon!*
